# IODetector
The app try to figure out at any given moment, the phone is in an indoor place or in an outdoor places. I utilized three mobile sensors: light sensor, magnetometer, and accelerometer to detect the location of users. The detection accuracy of the plugin is about 96.1%, and if the mobile phone gets further from buildings, the accuracy is higher.
The app also contains a compass and help users to find right direction.
